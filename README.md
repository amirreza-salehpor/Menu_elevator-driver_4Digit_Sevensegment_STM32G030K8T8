# Elevator Door Driver Configuration Panel ‚Äì STM32G030K8T8 Version

This project is a configuration panel for elevator door driver modules, built around the STM32G030K8T8 microcontroller. It includes a 4-digit seven-segment display for real-time status feedback and is designed to assist technician teams with diagnostics and configuration of elevator door drivers.

# üîß Project Overview
The device communicates with elevator door drivers installed on top of the elevator car and displays operational data, error codes, and status messages on a 4-digit seven-segment display. The panel is used during elevator installation and maintenance for parameter adjustment and monitoring.

#  üõ†Ô∏è My Contributions
* Designed the schematic and PCB layout using Altium Designer

* Developed firmware in Embedded C for STM32G030K8T8

* Implemented a communication protocol between the panel and driver module

* Controlled and updated 4-digit seven-segment display to show status and error codes

* Built and tested prototypes for field use by technician teams

# üí° Features
* Based on STM32G030K8T8 microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M0+)

* 4-digit 7-segment display for real-time monitoring

* Compact and reliable PCB design

* Simple user interface for technicians

* Compatible with existing elevator door drivers

# üß∞ Tools & Technologies
* STM32CubeIDE / Keil for firmware development

* Altium Designer for schematic and PCB design

* UART serial communication interface

* 7-segment display control via GPIO

# üöÄ Project Outcome
This version of the configuration panel was successfully integrated with elevator systems, offering a cost-effective and efficient tool for technical teams. Its compact design, live display, and STM32G0 platform made it highly reliable and easy to use in real-world field conditions.
